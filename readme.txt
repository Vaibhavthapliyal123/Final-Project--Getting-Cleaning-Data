Getting and cleaning data- course project

In this course project the run_analysis.R script performs the following work.

1.	Load the activity and feature information.
2.	Load training and test data sets keeping only those columns that reflect a mean or standard deviation.
3.	Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
4.	Merges the two datasets
5.	Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
6.	Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
